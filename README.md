# Global-Trends-and-Policy-in-Cyber-Security

This course provides an overview of cybersecurity capabilities and trends in the global community, complementing knowledge gained in other courses.  International organizations engaged in cybersecurity and the national strategies of many countries are examined in detail.  Students will gain insights into the political, economic, military, and technological components of cybersecurity as practiced in the U.S., UK, China, Russia, and other countries. The course is designed around four general themes: global cyber threats, strategies and policies in response to cyber threats, comparative cybersecurity capabilities of nation-states; and cybersecurity in international politics. Students will also gain an appreciation of how key cybersecurity issues like critical infrastructure protection and information sharing are addressed in an international context.  Extensive reading is required from sources that will be available on Blackboard, on-line, or via the JHU Library’s electronic reserves.
